# Rex Command Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: January 29, 2026
**Status**: 🎉 **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - All components working

## Summary

The `rex` command for extracting fields using regular expressions is now **100% complete** across all layers of the PPL stack. Rex is similar to parse but more flexible - it allows empty source fields (defaults to _raw) and is more lenient with missing fields.
